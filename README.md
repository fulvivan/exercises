# Description
I used this repository to practice JavaScript.

It has complete exercises with tests, in which I have imitated some JavaScript methods, such as concat, push, repeat, indexOf.......…
I wrote the functions from scratch, without using the built-in JavaScript methods, for me to better understand how they work.

There are also exercises that I have solved while following the program of a Boot Camp.
